If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could pick one part of my work on these documents to revise it would be simply a different approach. I mis read many of the topics due to my illness which caused me to turn in a completely different project than I was instructed of. This caused me to get a lower grade and if I could go back I would read more carefully and wish i started it before my illness.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How I interepreted it was each user will be able to register themselves on the platform,DriversPass. They will be able to make appointments, modify them and cancel them according to their needs. It is very important to consider the user's need since they will be the ones using it. Of course, our main goal is for them to enjoy it and find it non-intuitive. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The way I apprached this was by first looking at target audience. The target audience is basically the people who fail at their driving tests at DMV. Also the people who don't have much time to invest in learning driving could be the users as they can schedule an appointment according to their preferred time slots.
